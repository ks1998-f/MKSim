Second, it compiles MKSim source code and links all objects in "mksim" binary file, which is put in "bin" folder.

RUN

$ ./mksim -h

Outputs all parameters of the application.

To launch it with the configuration file:

$ ./mksim -c config_sample.conf

This will execute a simple prompt menu where you can import the path with documents
and also input a search query (keywords) to invoke the ranked search.
The result of ranked search is stored in a log file (typically, named "mksim.log" in "bin" folder).

ETC

Your can find the sample configuration file in "conf" folder.
Your can find textual document in "example" folder.
